⏺ Weather Radar 3D Implementation Plan for Slovenia

  Based on my analysis of the weather radar specification and research
   into Slovenia's data sources, here's a lean implementation plan:

  Phase 1: Lean MVP - Slovenia Focus

  Data Source Strategy

  Primary: ARSO (Slovenian Environment Agency) - meteo.arso.gov.si
  - Format: SRD (Simple UNIX ASCII raster format)
  - Coverage: Slovenia radar data with 5-level intensity (0-100:
  white, green, yellow, orange, red)
  - Update frequency: Every 10 minutes
  - API access: Community APIs available (github.com/zejn/arsoapi)

  Simplified Architecture

  Instead of full 3D Tiles pipeline, start with 2.5D approach:

  1. Data Processing: Convert ARSO SRD raster → GeoJSON polygons with
  height
  2. Visualization: Use Cesium's PolygonGraphics with extrudedHeight
  for 3D effect
  3. Storage: Static GeoJSON files cached locally (Slovenia is small
  ~20,000 km²)

  Implementation Components

  Core Files to Create:
  weather-radar/
  ├── weather-radar-manager.js    # Main controller
  ├── arso-data-service.js       # ARSO API integration
  ├── radar-polygon-renderer.js   # 2.5D polygon rendering
  └── weather-cache.js          # Local data caching

  Key Features (MVP):
  - 2.5D visualization: Radar returns as extruded polygons at
  realistic altitudes
  - Intensity levels: 5 colors matching ARSO's scale
  (white→green→yellow→orange→red)
  - Altitude mapping: Estimate heights based on meteorological
  principles
  - Time animation: 10-minute intervals with simple playback controls
  - Local caching: Store 6-12 hours of data locally

  Technical Approach

  1. Data Conversion Pipeline:
  // Convert ARSO raster to 3D polygons
  ARSOSRDData → IntensityGrid → ExtrudedPolygons → CesiumEntities

  2. Height Assignment:
  // Simple altitude mapping based on precipitation intensity
  const altitudeMapping = {
    0: 0,      // No precipitation
    25: 1500,  // Light (1.5km)
    50: 3000,  // Moderate (3km) 
    75: 4500,  // Heavy (4.5km)
    100: 6000  // Extreme (6km)
  };

  3. Polygon Rendering:
  // Create extruded polygons for each radar cell
  entity.polygon = new PolygonGraphics({
    hierarchy: cellBounds,
    material: intensityColor,
    extrudedHeight: estimatedAltitude,
    outline: false
  });

  Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Future)

  Advanced 3D Capabilities

  - Point cloud conversion: Migrate to full 3D Tiles when data volume
  increases
  - Multiple radar sites: Add neighboring countries (Austria, Italy,
  Croatia)
  - Vertical profiles: Show precipitation at different altitudes
  - Real-time updates: WebSocket integration for live data

  Data Integration

  - Weather stations: Overlay ground truth data
  - Lightning data: Add electrical activity visualization
  - Wind vectors: Show 3D wind field data
  - Forecasts: Integrate ARSO forecast models

  Implementation Advantages

  Why This Approach Works for Slovenia:

  1. Small coverage area: Slovenia's compact size makes full-country
  visualization feasible
  2. Simplified data: ARSO's 5-level system reduces complexity vs
  NEXRAD's 256 levels
  3. Proven source: ARSO is the authoritative meteorological service
  4. Community tools: Existing APIs reduce development overhead

  Performance Benefits:

  - Lightweight: Polygons use less memory than millions of points
  - Fast rendering: Cesium optimizes polygon rendering well
  - Gradual enhancement: Can migrate to point clouds when needed
  - Mobile friendly: Works well on tablets/phones

  Development Timeline:

  - Week 1: Basic ARSO integration + polygon rendering
  - Week 2: Time animation + local caching
  - Week 3: UI controls + altitude mapping refinement
  - Week 4: Testing + optimization

  Risk Mitigation

  Data Access: Use community APIs as primary, with fallback to screen
  scraping if needed
  Performance: Start with lower resolution (2km cells), increase
  gradually
  Accuracy: Focus on visual representation vs meteorological precision
   for MVP
  Maintenance: Cache data locally to reduce dependency on external
  services

  This lean approach provides immediate value while establishing the
  foundation for the full 3D Tiles implementation described in the
  specification document.
